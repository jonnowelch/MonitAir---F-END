            Too high humidity levels in your home not only cause discomfort but

            mildew, funghi, bacteria and viruses.

            When indoor air is too dry, asthma and allergy symptoms can worsen.
            Cold and flu viruses may spread more rapidly, and you may be more
            prone to sinus infections. You may suffer from dry skin, chapped
            lips, and dry air passageways.

          <Text>
            Dry air causes your body to feel colder, despite a warm indoor
            temperature. The dry air pulls moisture from your skin, leaving you
            colder and forcing you to turn up the temperature to stay
            comfortable. Therefore, more energy is expended to heat the home
            when a boost in humidity could have kept you comfortable for less.
