            You may suffer from dry skin, chapped lips, and dry air passageways.
            Dry air causes your body to feel colder, despite a warm indoor
            temperature. The dry air pulls moisture from your skin, leaving you
            colder and forcing you to turn up the temperature to stay
            comfortable. Therefore, more energy is expended to heat the home
            when a boost in humidity could have kept you comfortable for less.
